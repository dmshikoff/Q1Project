# Online Blackjack

As my Quarter 1 project, i chose to code a web version of a game. I don't typically care for the types of games that are fitting for a web application, but I do enjoy cards games. Narrowing it down to single player games; Solitaire and Blackjack, I settled on Blackjack due to its more simplified rules, and interactivity with a non-playing "dealer".
