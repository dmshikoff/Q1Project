# Online Blackjack

As my Quarter 1 project, I chose to code a web version of a game. I don't typically care for the types of games that are fitting for a web application, but I do enjoy cards games. Narrowing it down to single player games; Solitaire and Blackjack, I settled on Blackjack due to its more simplified rules, and interactivity with a non-playing "dealer".

## Getting Started

The very first step I took was setting the stage. Getting the basic layout designed would create a place for me to begin coding functionality and interactivity. I researched a number of online casino sites to get an idea of how to set up the layout.
